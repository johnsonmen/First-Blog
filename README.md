## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The First Blog project was built using Python 3.9.16
Please see the requirement.txt for required packages.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The project was an attempt to analyze the [World University Rankings of 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alitaqi000/world-university-rankings-2023) Dataset from Kaggle. We will conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, distribution of variables, and any missing or inconsistent data. The main questions are:

1. What are the distributions of the top 15 universities' scores?
2. What countries have the most universities ranked in the top 100 of the world?
3. What is the significant indicator of the rankings of the universities in this data?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The project incluces one `university_rankings_2023.csv` and one notebook file to showcase work related to the above question.
